# Ax=b

Ax=b &copy; 2018 [Andreas Mang](http://www.math.uh.edu/~andreas): This is a collection of Matlab code snippets to explore conceptual ideas in linear algebra. This toolkit is primarily designed to serve as a teaching tool.

### General Instructions
* To learn more about Matlab commands use the built in Matlab help and documentation. For example, if you want to learn about the `rand` command type `doc rand` or `help rand` into the Matlab command window.
* The documentation can also be found online. You can simply type `Matlab cmd`, where `cmd` represents the command or operation you are interested into your favorite search engine to learn more about it.
* Take a look at the scripts in the [examples](https://github.com/andreasmang/axisb/tree/master/examples) folder. These scripts provide code snippets to help you with your homework assignments.
* Send me an [email](andreas@math.uh.edu) to make an appointment or visit me during my office hours if you feel that the resources you can find online or above are not adequate.


### Download and Installation
* Downloading the code or getting familiar with GitHub or Git itself is not required. You can browse the repository by clicking on the folders and code files above. 
* You can download the code by clicking the `clone or download` bottom on the top right.
* To download the code simply select `Download ZIP`.
* Advanced instructions: To clone the code, create a directory, go to that directory in your command window and type the command `git clone git@github.com:andreasmang/axisb.git .`

### Running the Code
To run the examples and use the functions implemented in the `kernels` folder from the toplevel directory, run the `startup.m` script. This will add the necessary paths to your environment.
